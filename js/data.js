    	'Ethiopia’s faster population growth rate is represented by the fact that a much higher proportion of its population is under reproductive age (0–14). Using  2015 data, the numbers of individuals shown here who were 0–4 years old represent the following percentages of each country’s total population: Ethiopia 14.7%, United States 6.1%, Italy 4.3 %. Note that the U.S. population is growing slowly but still more than Italy’s, so its proportion of prereproductive and reproductive individuals (15–44) is higher than Italy’s.',
        'Using  2015 data, the numbers of individuals shown here who were 5–9 years old represent the following percentages of each country’s total population: Ethiopia 13.7%, United States 6.4%, Italy 4.7 %. Note that the U.S. population is growing slowly but still more than Italy’s, so its proportion of prereproductive and reproductive individuals (15–44) is higher than Italy’s.',

Note that the U.S. population is growing slowly but still more than Italy’s, so its proportion of prereproductive and reproductive individuals (15–44) is higher than Italy’s.',
        'Ethiopia’s faster-growing population includes a higher proportion of adolescents and young adults in their early reproductive years (15–29) than do Italy and U.S. populations, which are more stable across age blocks. Using  2015 data, the numbers of individuals shown here who were 15–19 years old represent the following percentages of each country’s total population: Ethiopia 11.8%, United States 6.4%, Italy 4.7%. Note that the U.S. population is growing slowly but still more than Italy’s, so its proportion of prereproductive and reproductive individuals under 35 is higher than Italy’s.',

Proportions of populations in the United States and Italy are either stable or increased in the later reproductive years (30–44).
